This project was made after looking at Evan Wallace's Float-toy, a great tool: https://github.com/evanw/float-toy 
Having various width floating points is helpful when dealing with modern graphics API's. BF16, Tf32 and other formats specialised for neural networks and machine learning are not currently supported in float toy; this aims to help that.
